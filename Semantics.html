            <h>WEBSITE SEMATICS, SEO AND ACCESIBILITY</h>
			<p>The term semantics can be understood as the appropriate interpretation of words and their meanings. When it comes to web development, semantic markup is what developers use to write and structure their HTML such that it highlights the meaning of the content and not just its appearance. This process involves the utilization of meta data as a means of describing web content. There are two aspects to understanding web semantics a) the fact that the web browser understands what is displayed, and b) the reader comprehends the tags as represented such as when the paragraph tag < p > is used to indicates that the next is a paragraph (Baker, 2007). The objective of semantic markup is to eliminate vagueness by precisely transmitting information through communication means.

			The acronym SEO is commonly used to refer to search engine optimization, which is a means of increasing how often the content of a website is displayed by search engines. Through the use of SEO developers can figure out the most searched web content on the Internet so they can have the same data recorded in a database (Nguyen, 2016). The technique uses keywords in a complex process that displays and ranks websites. Similarly, web accessibility can be understood as the process of easing the difficulty of web access by different users regardless of the level of technology they are utilizing. Accessibility is most important among blind users but is also considered for the elderly, those with color blindness, those accessing on mobile devise, individuals with vision impairment, as well as those with slow Internet connection and old browsers (Baker, 2007).

			The intersection between accessibility, SEO and semantic markup cannot be overlooked since they are all connected and have to be considered together when creating web content. For example, if a website has the appropriately structured semantic markup, then SEO will be able to identify the accessible pages and rank them according to search engine results. Even when users have disabilities, it is possible for them to engage with accessible websites by using assistive technology (Search Engine Land, 2017). Overall, is a website has correct semantic markup then it is easily accessed by various users.
