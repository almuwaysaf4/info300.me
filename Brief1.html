            <h>I. Introduction</h>
            <p>
Smartphones and tablets have become the most popular devices in the 21st Century. Even though many people, on many occasions, confuse the two devices by commonly considering them as mobile phones, when it comes to mobile marketing, many marketers frequently think that tablets and smartphones are in the same category. Despite the two devices having similarities in their form factor and their resemblance in the touch-oriented interface, smartphones and tablets have quite a considerate number of differences between them, ranging from their sizes, how the devices work, how they are used, and many others. 
			</p> 
			<h>Brief Definition of Mobile phone and a Tablet</h>
			<p>
			Tablets can be viewed as an enlarged or improved version of a smartphone when in actual sense they are not. Tablets are devices that possess their own exclusive audience. The accomplishments the device is largely used for is remarkably different. The things their users are using for and the places the tablet devices are used at, are very much distinct in nature when related to smartphone devices.

			<h>History of Smartphones and Tablets</h>
			<p>
			 The History and Evolution of Smartphones: 1992 – 2020 
Smartphone devices have taken so many years in their evolution journey. It has taken the device 28 years to reach the current year, 2020, at the same time, making several alterations and modifications along its evolution journey. Apparently smartphone’s evolution has taken the market by storm. Initially, smartphones were large in sizes and bulky. But currently the devices have evolved to lesser in size, compact, and more useful that users can hardly live without. In the year 1992, one Tech Company, IBM developed the world’s first smartphone device that had more capabilities than its earlier cell devices. The smartphone was huge in size but was somewhat named Simon. The Simon Personal Communicator had most of the modern features that relates to a current smartphone. They included the touch screen, email, notes and calendar, Fax, apps and other widgets. Despite having all these current features, the smartphone did not see its way to 1994. The second phase was the Blackberry which targeted mostly the business professionals. The features of the first blackberry devices included the calendar, music, full keyboard, internet access, and advance security. By releasing more devices in the market, the blackberry smartphone became the market leader in smartphones. This was quashed by the introduction of iPhone devices. Apple phones entered the smartphone race through changing how the device users used the portable technology. Noticeably, iPhones were the most advanced smartphone devices in the market. Launched in 2007, Apple Company sold up to 1.4 million iPhones in its first year in the market. It later exploded in the following year to 11.6 million sales (Reid, 2018).
The History and Evolution of Tablet.

			<p>
			In 1968, Alan Kay, a computer scientist, came up with an idea of advancing flat-panel display technology, miniaturization of computer components, experimental work in Wi-Fi technology, and user interfaces. He believed that by combining all these advancements will develop one computing device that will incorporate all of them. Alan Kay advanced the idea more by explaining that such a computing device would fit well as an educational tool learners in school. In 1972, the computer scientist made a book, the Dynabook that described the device (Strickland, 2011). The Dynabook roughly showed a device that was very comparable to the modern tablet devices, but with little exclusions. It had a keyboard and a screen all together on the same surface. By Alan Key’s ideas continued to grow immensely as he projected that, we could do away with a physical keyboard if we have the right touch screen technology. Instead, a virtual keyboard would display on the screen in any configuration. 
The first tablet was the GRiDPad, produced in 1989. Jeff Hwakins was the man behind the GRiDPad. The tablet device comprised of a wired stylus and a monochromatic capacitance touch screen. GRiDPad device weighed approximately 2.26 kilograms. When compared to the modern tablet, it had short life battery of 3 hours and was heavy. Several other pen-based tablet devices followed, but they did not receive the amount of support they wanted from the public. Apple Company then entered the market with the Newton, a computing tablet that received love and mockery in equal measure over the years. In this current era, most companies, such as Google, Apple, HP, and Microsoft, are trying to forecast the needs of their consumers while crafting the next generation of tablet devices.
			</p>
			<h>II. Differences in features and physical attributes</h>
			<p>
Both devices differ in physical attributes. Tablets have bigger screens than smartphones. Due to their size, they tend to have higher resolution and longer battery life. This makes them ideal for the long media content (Appsee, 2018). These attributes also make tablets better for gaming and other high-power consuming applications and use. Though both tablets and smartphones have android operating system, there are differences in the applications available for each of this devices, some of which can only be run in tablets and not in smartphones. 
			</P>
			<h>Portability</h>
			<p>
			Smartphones are easy to easy to carry along as compared to the tablet device. In many cases, smartphones are a great target for market strategies. Unlike the tablet, smartphones are used as communication device and also have a constant internet connectivity. One crucial thing that samples the two devices is that smartphones receive constant SMS messages, whereas tablets do not receive SMS messages. Tablets are not carried everywhere since they are not types of communication device. Most tablet users keep them at home or in the office. Smartphones, on the other hand, are taken everywhere the user visits. This makes smartphones a necessity while tablets are a productivity device or luxury.
			</p>
			<h>Difference in Use</h>
			<p>
			Mobile phones are primarily used for personal communications purposes. This includes making calls, assessing social media platforms, receiving emails, and online shopping. Many mobile phone users prefer keeping private content in their smartphones and even put passwords to safeguard their information (Appsee, 2018). Tablets tend to be shared among users and are primarily used for digital media content. In most cases, smartphones are shared among family members or office colleagues. This means there is less emotional attachment to the tablet compared to smartphones.
			</p>
			<h>Amount of time spent on each device</h>
			<p>
			Mobile devices and tablets differ in the amount of time used on each device. In most cases, mobile phones are used for a short time but more frequently than tablets. Tablet users often spend more time per session but use them less frequently (Tanham, 2018).  The average session time for tablets is twice the time spend on mobile devices (Tanham, 2018). This has made tablets more popular incorporates that have important data to analyze. In such cases, companies prefer tablets due to the ability to view more data and even compare data points in the market.
			</p>
			<h>User demographics</h>
			<p>
			There is also a difference in user demographics. Smartphones are predominantly used by the older generation. The majority of young people especially between 1980 and 1996 prefer using smartphones. This age group prefers the privacy and convenience that comes with smartphones. They can access their social media platforms on the go, and shop online. Tablets more popular with the older generation (Tanham, 2018). Older people prefer them since they normally don’t carry their devices in public, can enjoy larger screens, longer battery life, and access their favorite digital media. 
			</p>

			<h>Application developments</h>
			<p> 
			There is also a difference in the app development in both devices. Due to the difference in the screen size of the two devices, mobile app and tablet app development differ greatly. The choice of a mobile application depends on the products offered by a company, and the target audience (Gomez et al., 2020). Many organizations are now shifting to tablet-specific applications due to the larger displays and longer battery life. Users can also view and compare multiple data sets at once. 
			</p>
			<h>Connectivity</h>
			<p>
			All smartphones have both Wi-Fi and 4G connectivity. Lately, 5G connectivity has been introduced but very few countries and smartphone companies have the 5G connection. On the other hand, tablets have only Wi-Fi connectivity and they lack the 3G/4G connectivity. 
			</p>
			<h>Price Difference</h>
			<p>
			Due to their size, may people would expect tablets to be very expensive as compared to smartphones due to their big size. However, this is not the case for most brands as smartphone prices are almost twice that of a smartphone.
			</p>
			<h>The Generation Difference</h>
			<p>
			The last difference between smartphones and tablets is on the users. The millennials, (any one born between 1981 and 1996) are most inclined to love using smartphones as compared to the older generation. Most tablets users are heavily understood to pick tablet devices. In this difference, it shows that diverse age groups have dissimilar expectations and needs. Tablets are mostly seen entertainment platform, while the smartphones are taken mostly as communication device. 
			</p>
			<h>III. Conclusion</h>
			<p>
			From the above, discussion, tablets, and mobile devices differ significantly. These differences include physical appearance, amount to time spent on each device, user demographics, application development, battery life, number of users per device, type of content accessed, connectivity, cost, and generation difference. Marketers and decision-makers should therefore not lump the two devices together but instead explore ways of maximizing the benefits associated with each device. Consumers and commercial users should consider these differences when choosing the devices in order to fit the required need.
